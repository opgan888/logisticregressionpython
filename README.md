# BinaryNNLogisticRegressionPractice
Binary classification with Logistic Regression based Neural Network 

## Set up working environment
* create virtual environment: ```virtualenv ENV```
    - remove directory: ``` rm -f hENV```
* add ```source ENV/bin/activate``` in .bashrc file
    edit bashrc file ```vim ~/.bashrc``` and goes to the last line: ```shift + g``` 
* create Makefile for make utility : ``` touch Makefile ```
    - rename a file: ```mv oldfilename newfilename```
* create Requirements.txt for package install : ``` touch Requirement.txt ```
    - find out package version ```pip freeze | less```
    - create library folder: ``` mkdir myLib ```


## Train Neural Network model
* Injest data

* EDA

* Modelling

* Conclusion
